## About

I build systems that connect millions of people with content they care about. Currently leading the development of Yahoo’s next-generation recommendation infrastructure—modernizing how we serve personalized content with LLM-powered systems that enable faster iteration and better user experiences.

**How I work:** I do whatever the project needs to succeed. Sometimes that means leading design discussions and coordinating across teams. Sometimes it means writing production code at 11pm to hit a launch deadline. Sometimes it means diving into research papers to figure out if a new technique will actually work at scale. I’ve led projects, written papers, debugged distributed systems, and refactored legacy codebases—whatever moves the work forward.

**What I do:** End-to-end applied ML and systems work, from initial exploration to production deployment. My work spans recommendation systems, ad tech optimization, content moderation, and infrastructure that enables other engineers to move faster. I’m comfortable being hands-on with code or stepping back to design architecture and coordinate execution.

**Background:** U.S. citizen with 8+ years at Yahoo, working across research and engineering. Computer Science degrees from Ohio State (MS) and National Central University (BS). Experienced in Python, Scala, TypeScript, and several other languages.


## Recent Work

### Yahoo News Recommendation Systems (2023–present)

Co-leading the design of Yahoo’s next-generation recommendation system—rethinking how we serve personalized content at scale.

**The opportunity:** Build cloud-native, Python-first systems that integrate modern ML techniques including LLMs. Focus on faster experimentation cycles while maintaining performance standards and improving personalization quality.

**What we’re building:** Complete stack from notebooks to data pipelines to production traffic handling. The system powers content feeds across multiple surfaces and represents a fundamental shift in how Yahoo approaches content recommendation.

**The Artifact integration:** Following Yahoo’s acquisition of Artifact (the AI news app from Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger), I led technical aspects of integrating their technology into Yahoo’s ecosystem. Worked directly with the founding team to understand their product and engineering approaches, successfully launching their app as the new Yahoo News mobile experience.

*Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger previously founded Instagram; Mike Krieger is now Chief Product Officer at Anthropic*


## Selected Projects

### Ad Tech & Optimization

**Traffic Optimization** — Redesigned traffic handling for Yahoo’s ad exchange, achieving substantial cost reduction while maintaining revenue targets. Developed offline estimation frameworks that enabled data-driven decision making before running live experiments.

**Creative Policy Systems** — Built advanced text and image classification models that dramatically improved precision in ad policy enforcement, significantly reducing manual review burden. Developed LSH-based algorithms for creative deduplication that improved both system performance and training data quality.

**Business Metrics Optimization** — Designed and prototyped optimization models for key ad exchange metrics, providing clear impact analysis that informed strategic business decisions.

### Content Moderation & Safety

**User-Generated Content Systems** — Developed multiple generations of text and image classifiers for content moderation:

- Early BERT adoption (2019) that outperformed existing production systems
- Transfer learning approaches using modern architectures (Xception, EfficientNet)
- Proactive toxic comment prediction to manage high-engagement content
- Search suggestion moderation with improved coverage of emerging problematic terms

**Ad Creative Tools** — Deployed BERT-based optimization service with kNN search, enabling advertisers to improve creative quality. Achieved significant API latency improvements through optimization work.

### Enterprise Security

**Threat Detection Systems** — Built large-scale data exfiltration detection using synthetic attack patterns to identify suspicious activity for security team investigation.

**Network Security** — Created data enrichment pipelines for enterprise Netflow data, enhancing intrusion detection capabilities at scale.

**Authentication Security** — Implemented deep learning models achieving strong performance for Yahoo’s membership security systems.

### Developer Infrastructure

**Systems & Tools** — Contributions that improved team productivity:

- Established JupyterHub infrastructure with custom PySpark kernels
- Introduced Horovod for distributed training on internal Kubernetes GPU clusters
- Modernized ML monitoring dashboards and reporting
- Implemented CICD pipelines and conducted major codebase refactoring
- Built notebook automation features for reproducible workflows


## Publications & Patents

**10+ peer-reviewed publications** at venues including EMNLP, CIKM, IEEE TNNLS, and IEEE Big Data. Topics span text moderation, creative optimization, graph neural networks, and distributed AutoML systems.

**4 patents and trade secrets** covering content moderation systems, ad creative optimization, and security technologies.
