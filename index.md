## About me

-   __US citizen__, Master's in Computer Science.
-   Working on __data science__ and __applied machine learning__. Projects include but are not limited to __Vision__ and __NLP__.
-   Also does front-end, back-end, and anything needed to make things work.
-   Versatile tech stack, a few mentions: __Spark__, __TensorFlow__, __K8s__.

## Project

_TechPulse_ is a conference within Yahoo! with an acceptance rate of ~15%.

### Ads policy moderation <sup>TechPulse 2020</sup>

> Trained and deployed __NLP ML model__ to __AWS ECS__ in order to help __policy moderation__. Compared to the previous solution, the precision improved __from 33% to 97%__. It's a heavy-loaded service that handles __millions of requests__ each day.

### Interactive Ads optimization <sup>TechPulse 2020</sup>

> Formalized __NLP ML model__ built in __TensorFlow__ to __K8s cluster__ as a service. It helps users to interactively __improve advertisement__ in the process of creation. Reduced the response time from prototype's __3 seconds to under 1 second__.

### Comment moderation <sup>TechPulse 2019</sup>

> Trained and deployed __NLP ML model__ as well as __Vision ML model__, both written in __TensorFlow__, to __K8s cluster__ as services. The services help __content moderation__ by auto flagging violations. __Reduced error rate by 10%__. It's a heavy-loaded service that handles __tens of thousands of requests__ per day.

### Comment understanding

> Deployed an on-demand model training procedure to __K8s cluster__ as a service. It allows a quick understanding of the comment topics under each article. It's a heavy-loaded service that handles __tens of thousands of requests__ per day.

### Enterprise network security <sup>TechPulse 2019</sup>

> Created scalable detection systems in Hadoop, detecting __abnormal and malicious behaviors__ the enterprise network traffic. The volume is __300 million__ per day.  

### User login security <sup>TechPulse 2018</sup>

> Trained ML model built in __TensorFlow__ and __XGBoost__ to production. The models minimize the interruption to real users while __maintaining security__. The volume is __14M__ per day.

### Notebook automation <sup>TechPulse 2018</sup>

> Built a feature to easily automate notebooks in the __Hadoop__ system. It accelerates the transformation from prototypes in notebooks into pipelines.

## Work experience

### 2017 - present, Yahoo!, USA

> The projects listed above are all done within this period.

### 2012, Lisco Global Solutions LID., Taiwan

> Worked as a summer intern, the work includes feature implementation and Microsoft Office integration.

## Education

### 2015 - 2017, The Ohio State University, USA

> Master's Degree, Computer Science.
> Worked on visualization related projects including data visualization and visualization systems.

### 2010 - 2014, National Central University, Taiwan

> Bachelor of Science, Computer Science.
> Worked on Human-Computer Interaction related projects such as virtual instruments enabled by human gesture tracking.
