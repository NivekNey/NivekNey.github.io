### Ads policy moderation (*2020)

> Trained and deployed NLP ML model to AWS ECS in order to help policy moderation. Compared to previous solution, improved precision from 33% to 95%. It's a high-load service that handles millions of requests per day. 

### Interactive Ads optimization (*2020)

> Formalized NLP ML model built in TensorFlow to K8s cluster as a service. Reduced the response time from prototype's 3 seconds to under 1 second. 

### Comment moderation (*2019)

> Trained and deployed NLP ML model as well as Vision ML model, both written in TensorFlow, to K8s cluster as services. Reduced error rate by 10%. It's a high-loaded service that handles tens of thousands of requests per day.

### Comment understanding

> Deployed on-demand model training procedure to K8s cluster. It's a high-loaded service that handles tens of thousands of requests per day.

### Enterprise network security (*2019)

> Hadoop

### User login security (*2018)

> Hadoop TF XGB

### Notebook automation (*2018)

> Jupyter Hadoop Oozie
